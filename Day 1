**Day 1: Getting Started with Ubuntu Linux EC2 Instance**

Welcome to Day 1 of the Linux Project Creation Challenge! Today, we'll dive into the basics of connecting to an Ubuntu Linux EC2 instance using the Bash terminal.

**Step 1: Connect to your Ubuntu Linux EC2 Instance**

1. Open your terminal (Bash).
2. Locate the private key (.pem) file associated with your EC2 instance.
3. Use the SSH command to connect to your EC2 instance:
   ```
   ssh -i /path/to/private-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-instance-ip
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/private-key.pem` with the path to your private key file, and `your-ec2-instance-ip` with your EC2 instance's public IP address.

**Step 2: Basic File Operations**

Now that you're connected to your EC2 instance, let's perform some basic file operations:

1. **Create a Directory:**
   ```
   mkdir mydirectory
   ```

2. **Create a File:**
   ```
   touch myfile.txt
   ```

3. **Print Working Directory:**
   ```
   pwd
   ```

4. **Delete a File:**
   ```
   rm myfile.txt
   ```

5. **Delete a Directory:**
   ```
   rmdir mydirectory
   ```

**Step 3: File Permissions**

Understanding and managing file permissions is crucial in Linux:

1. **Review File Permissions:**
   ```
   ls -l
   ```

2. **Change File Permissions:**
   ```
   chmod permissions filename
   ```
   Replace `permissions` with the desired permissions (e.g., `u+x` to add execute permission for the owner) and `filename` with the name of the file.

**Step 4: Linux Filesystem**

Take a moment to explore the Linux filesystem and understand its structure. Use commands like `ls`, `cd`, and `pwd` to navigate through directories.

**Step 5: Copy Files**

Finally, let's copy files from one directory to another:

```
cp source-file destination-directory
```

Replace `source-file` with the name of the file you want to copy and `destination-directory` with the directory where you want to paste the file.

Congratulations on completing Day 1 of the Linux Project Creation Challenge! Tomorrow, we'll dive deeper into Linux system administration tasks.
