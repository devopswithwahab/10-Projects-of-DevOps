**Day 5: Introduction to CI/CD**

Welcome to Day 5 of the 10-Day DevOps Challenge! Today, we dive into the world of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), an essential practice in modern software development.

**1. What is CI/CD?**

CI/CD is a set of practices used by development teams to automate the process of integrating code changes into a shared repository (Continuous Integration) and deploying those changes to production environments (Continuous Deployment) in a rapid and reliable manner.

**2. What Problem Does it Solve?**

CI/CD solves several common challenges faced by development teams, including:
- Manual and error-prone deployment processes
- Long release cycles leading to delayed feedback
- Difficulty in identifying and resolving integration issues
- Inconsistent development environments across teams

**3. The 5 Stages of CI/CD:**

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** The practice of frequently merging code changes into a shared repository, where automated tests are run to validate the changes.
- **Continuous Build:** The process of automatically compiling code, running unit tests, and generating artifacts upon each code commit.
- **Continuous Deployment:** The automation of deploying code changes to production or staging environments after passing all tests.
- **Continuous Testing:** The ongoing process of running automated tests at various stages of the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality and functionality.
- **Continuous Delivery:** The ability to release code changes to production environments quickly and safely, often with the click of a button.

**4. Steps to Setup Infrastructure:**

To set up the infrastructure for CI/CD, follow these steps:
- Launch three Ubuntu EC2 instances named DevServer, QAServer, and ProdServer.
- Connect to the DevServer and install Java, Jenkins, Git, and Maven.
- Connect to the QAServer and install Tomcat.
- Connect to the ProdServer and install Tomcat.
- Configure Jenkins on the DevServer to automate the CI/CD pipeline.

By implementing CI/CD practices, you can streamline your development process, improve code quality, and deliver software faster and more reliably. Stay tuned for Day 6, where we'll dive deeper into configuring Jenkins for CI/CD automation.
